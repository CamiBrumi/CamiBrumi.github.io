# Lab 4: My Portfolio
Please note that the project was stored in the /lab4 folder in the github.io special repo because I already had a github.io page.


## Aspects of the work that have been correctly implemented and what have not

I believe that my html was correctly implemented:
- My html and css passed the the official HTML5 and CSS validation tests.
- I used one CSS file.
- I didn't use any styling element html and I defined them in the CSS file.
- I didn't use any styling attribute in elements.
- I used a relative URL for my image.
- I didn't use any front-end framework for this lab.
- I used my own, created-from-scratch CSS file.
- I used HTML and CSS only for the purposes of this project.
- I stored this project in my github.io repo.

I think I should have used more than one CSS file, one for each html file.
I believe this is why I could not perfectly center the link items and the image in the index file.

## Whom I have collaborated or discussed the lab
~ No one.

## approximately how many hours I have spent completing the lab
4-5 hours.
