Undergraduate Research Assistant
GVIL Lab, University of Maryland, College Park
<p>Currently researching on how to obtain an animation from a single image,
    e.g. a landscape with a lake, mountains and clouds. I am researching how
    to animate just the water and clouds from the image in the example above,
    without altering the other objects. I am working with
    <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~varshney/" target="_blank">Prof. Amitabh Varshney</a>
    and his Ph.D. student
    <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=m2WsdmkAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">David Li</a>.
    During Fall 2019 I was working on a warm-up project about foveated 360ยบ video
    streaming with a focus on sampling methods to reduce the required bandwidth between
    server and a client. Accomplishments: </p>
