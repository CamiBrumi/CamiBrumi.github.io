### My first assignment.

Description: I have created an interactive animation, which is launched when a button is clicked.
Technical Achievements:
<ul>
  <li>I have learned some HTML and JavaScript and I have done my first project in these languages.</li>
  <li>I have learned how to create shapes (circles, squares, lines, triangles) with d3.js and how to animate them.</li>
  <li>I added some style to the lines in addition to the usual attributes of the lines.</li>
  <li>I added animation to the squares, which is launched by the user when he/she clicks the button “CLICK HERE TO SEE SOME MAGIC”. In other words, I have learned how to properly use the method transition().</li>
  <li>I learned how to add elements to the canvas without using absolute coordinates, but using percentages of the dimensions of the screen.</li>
</ul>

<br>
Design Achievements:
<ul>
  <li>I have designed how the letters should appear out of some lines lying on the margin of the canvas.</li>
  <li>I also chose the letters to appear vertically because it is a more dynamic design instead of a static horizontal design.</li>
</ul>
